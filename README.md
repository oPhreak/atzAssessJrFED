# Case Assessment for ATZ

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Comments
No changelog, should probably be doing that though

Failed to develop anything in React Native as the environment setup got messed up somehow... was taking way too long to fix the sysadmin issues and $PATH variables on both my Ubuntu and macOS machines.

List comprehension in RenderPanels.jsx had many issues but it was resolved eventually. Took a majority of my time on 01-24.

Successfully learned and implemented MUI/Grid component for RenderPanels.jsx
--> needs to be tweaked with gutters and spacing

Hardcoded most of the Footer, would have liked to create separate Grid items for each. Conditional rendering needs to be used for smaller viewports.

Responsiveness was a major focus on this project. Would have been simple enough to just hard code everything for the purpose of this assessment - copy paste twice and tweak but that is terrible practise.

Also implemented very basic unit tests using react-testing-library and jest-dom.

Downloading and applying external font families was trivial. Downloaded similar fonts from Google Fonts as the propietary fonts families were not provided.
